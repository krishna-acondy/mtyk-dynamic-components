# mtyk-dynamic-components

A React TypeScript app demonstrating dynamic component configuration from schemas and templates
With this app, I'd like to demonstrate a proof of concept for dynamically generating components
using a combination of pre-defined schemas, runtime configuration and transforms.

## Running the app locally

This app uses `pnpm` for dependency management.
To run the app, first install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
Then, run `pnpm run dev` to get a local dev server running.

## Deployments
The app is deployed to GitHub Pages at https://krishna-acondy.io/mtyk-dynamic-components/.
Deployments are configured via a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on pushes to `main`.
A deployment can also be manually triggered from the 'Actions' page.
